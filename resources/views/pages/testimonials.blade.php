                <p>I called Noah for my black 2012 M6 BMW  for a full detailing, because I have scratches from a car wash I took my car. He explain what needs to be than and he was very knowledgeable to his craft, he took  almost 6 hours to complete the job but I didn't believe my eyes and my car even look newer than the day I bought it, it was worth calling him and surely will  recommend him to my friends and family members.</p>

                <p>Noah detailed my old Toyota Corolla 95 car right before i sold it. The car looked amazing and brand new. It looked so impeccable, i almost didn't want to let the car go. It was my first car ever and i loved it even more after the detailing job. Noah is very professional, timely and patiently cleans and details every crevasse of the car. He treats every car like gold. Excellent service!!!!</p>
